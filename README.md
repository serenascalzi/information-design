# Information Design

## Identity Design Elements
- Matrix: The painting thumbnails in this gallery, which become active when a user hovers over them, are displayed in a matrix.
- Spatial Zoom: When a user clicks on a thumbnail, the full painting is displayed on the screen.
- Overlay: When the full painting is displayed, it acts as an overlay. The painting becomes active, while the previously active gallery becomes inactive.
- Linear: The overlay includes its own navigational elements, which appear when a user hovers over the left or right side of the overlay. Users can navigate between the paintings in a linear fashion. They can also close the overlay using a button that remains visible at all times.

## Norman’s Considerations
- Knowledge in the Head/World: Although this design presents information regarding Vincent van Gogh’s life and work, it also includes links to additional information from The Met and the Van Gogh Museum. The design acts as a reference from which users can access this information, rather than having to recall it.
- Simplified Structure of Tasks: The links and navigational elements in this design dictate the tasks that users are able to perform. These tasks are communicated to users through text and hover effects.
- Mappings: The overlay includes embedded navigational elements, some of which appear when a user hovers. The page includes links displayed in close proximity to the text to which they correspond.
- Constraints: The navigational elements in the overlay constrain users’ movement among elements. The links throughout the page constrain the tasks and information available to users.
- Error Design: This design is responsive — it is optimized to function and display properly across devices. It also includes a link that generates an email for error reporting.
